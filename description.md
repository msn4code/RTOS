1. **Header Files**: The code begins by including the necessary header files: `avr/io.h` for AVR I/O operations, `avr/interrupt.h` for interrupt-related functions, and `util/delay.h` for delay functions.

2. **Constants and Definitions**: The code defines some constants and definitions. `STACK_SIZE` represents the size of the stack allocated for each task, and `MAX_TASKS` represents the maximum number of tasks in the system. The `TaskControlBlock` structure is defined to hold the task stack and task function pointer.

3. **Task Functions**: The code defines the task functions that represent the different tasks to be executed. In this example, three tasks are defined: `task1`, `task2`, and `task3`. Each task contains an infinite loop that performs a specific action, such as toggling an LED and introducing a delay.

4. **Task Control Block (TCB) Array**: The code declares an array of `TaskControlBlock` structures named `tcb`, with a size equal to `MAX_TASKS`. This array will hold the stack and function pointers for each task.

5. **Global Variables**: The code declares a global variable `currentTask` to keep track of the currently executing task.

6. **Hardware Initialization Functions**: The code defines several functions to initialize the hardware. `initializePorts` sets the LED pins as outputs. `initializeTimers` configures Timer0 for CTC (Clear Timer on Compare) mode with a specific prescaler and compare value to generate interrupts at a regular interval. `initializeInterrupts` enables the Timer0 compare match interrupt.

7. **Context Switching Functions**: The code includes the `contextSwitch` and `restoreContext` functions responsible for saving and restoring the context of tasks. The `contextSwitch` function saves the current context by pushing the registers onto the stack. The `restoreContext` function restores the context by popping the registers from the stack.

8. **Timer Interrupt Handler**: The code defines the Timer0 compare match interrupt handler (`TIMER0_COMPA_vect`). Inside this interrupt handler, the current context is saved using `contextSwitch`, the next task is determined, and the context of the next task is restored using `restoreContext`. This allows for context switching between tasks when the interrupt occurs.

9. **Main Function**: The code enters the `main` function where the hardware is initialized, tasks are assigned to the `tcb` array, interrupts are enabled, and the first task is started.

10. **Main Loop**: Although the code includes a `while` loop in the `main` function, it is not utilized in this example. The actual task execution and switching occur inside the interrupt handler, and the `while` loop is left empty.

The code sets up a basic framework for multitasking using the First-Come, First-Served (FCFS) algorithm. Each task is assigned a separate stack, and the Timer0 interrupt triggers the context switching between tasks. The `task1`, `task2`, and `task3` functions represent different tasks that perform LED blinking with different delay intervals.
